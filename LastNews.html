				<p>The top 12 teams of europe are trying to downgrade the UEFA Champions League Cup, while trying to create
				a new cup named the Super League, consisting 15 founder teams, plus 5 more that will be incorporated according to their
				results and efforts at the end of the season. This new cup is creatin a lot of controversy since it would mean that
				smaller teams would not be able to progress more because of salary differences and all spectators and TV streamings going
				into the Super League. The FIFA and UEFA are trying everything they can do to stop the creation of this cup. </p>

			<content>
				<p>The NFL has just recently approved to change the rules for the 2021 season. They highlight a relaxation 
				to the rules of numbering jerseys by positions in the field and expansion of the powers of the review officer for the coming regular season. Replay officers will not be able to toss tissues on their own or reverse calls on their own. But, they will now be able to offer advice to the referees based on what they have seen in replays during the broadcast regarding possession, passes completions or interceptions, the placement of the ball relative to the sideline or end line, and whether a player has made down by contact. If you want to know more, you can visit the
