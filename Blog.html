				<h4>Athlete activism over race</h4>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>The pandemic and racial justice movement have disrupted life as we know it and sparked innovations to shift consciousness at every level of sport. Our athletes are no longer asking for permission but leveraging their social capital to send a clear and direct message to their coaches and administrators: join them or get out of the way. As a result, the need for every coach and athletic administrator to go through a social and cultural competence “basic training” of sorts when it comes to working with athletes and engaging colleagues from underrepresented backgrounds is urgent.</p>

				<h4>Sports media layoffs</h4>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>Nearly all of the leading sports media companies have had layoffs, led by ESPN. Networks continue to think about remote productions and slimmed down productions, so one issue is jobs in sports media. There is also the question of access. On the other side of the pandemic, will sports reporters be able to roam locker rooms before and after games in the same ways they were before and what impact would that have on coverage? We’ve also seen cord-cutting continue and the big media companies think more about streaming and direct-to-consumer, which in the next few years will likely have a bigger impact on how and where fans can watch games.</p>

				<h4>Technology in Sports</h4>
			</header>
			<content>
				<p>We have seen increased use of our sports communication and management platform in spite of reduced competitive activity, and we know there is no turning back. Experiencing how solutions like ours can reduce drudgery, save time, and facilitate sharing creates new expectations for athletes and their families. They will no longer accept traditional approaches. Nor will administrators in sports organizations. Similarly, the pandemic crisis has led to phenomenal growth in e-commerce. Society at large and purchasers of sports gear will simply no longer accept the hassle of purchasing products from local dealers. Sports gear brands, now that they have tasted the value of direct to consumer commerce, will also loathe returning to the past.</p>
